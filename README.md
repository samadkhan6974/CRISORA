#CRISORA The Weather & Disaster Management System is a smart solution designed to help communities and authorities monitor weather conditions and manage natural disasters effectively. It provides real-time weather updates, predicts potential hazards, and sends timely alerts to minimize risks. The system features an interactive dashboard for visualizing weather patterns and disaster-prone areas, while also assisting in efficient resource management during emergencies. Built using Python, Flask, and modern web technologies, this project aims to enhance preparedness and save lives during critical weather events.
