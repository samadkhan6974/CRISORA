Disaster Preparedness & Response Education System
Natural disasters like floods, storms, and earthquakes pose a serious threat to communities, especially in vulnerable regions. Our Disaster Preparedness and Response Education System aims to educate individuals, schools, and local authorities about disaster risks and response strategies. By providing timely information, interactive learning modules, and real-time alerts, this system empowers people to act effectively before, during, and after disasters, minimizing damage and saving lives
